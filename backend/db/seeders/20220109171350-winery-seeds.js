They were pioneers of organic viticulture from the outset, refusing to yield to the temptations of chemical substances and gradually inspiring other winemakers. Since 2017, the Bouygues family has owned this mysterious estate and its legendary wines, true jewels of the Saumur-Champigny appellation. Today, the estate has found new balance thanks to Richard, a passionate winegrower, and Jacques-Antoine, a craftsman of fine wines. They both work with the team to perpetuate the excellence and uniqueness of wines with unparalleled depth, finesse and precision.`,

They cover the eastern arm of France and are the remnants of the once mighty Hercynian mountain range. These eroded ancient rocks are a cocktail of granites, shale, schist, tuffs (volcanic ash, not tuffeau), hard coal, sandstone, and quartzite. The hills of the Côteaux du Layon are the result of a geological fault that is 120 kilometers long, which goes from the north of Nantes all the way to the south of Saumur. The fault was created during the rising of the Alps. The vineyards are situated north of the fault (and the Layon), on hills facing south and southwest that only reach up to 80 meters above sea level. Southwest of the Layon, the Massif Vendeen rises up to 200 meters and deflects the clouds that come up from the Atlantic. This means that despite its proximity to the Atlantic, the Côteaux du Layon receives some of the lowest rainfall in France, an average of only 600 millimeters per year, very similarly to Alsace and the Vosges mountains. But little rainfall does not mean low humidity.`,

The history of vineyards in this area dates back to before the Romans, when the Phoenicians settled here and planted vines. In fact, they claimed to have civilized the barbarians with wine. During the 13th and 14th centuries the wines of Saint-Pourçain were highly esteemed. They traveled up to Paris via the Allier and Loire rivers and were favored by Popes, royalty and the aristocracy alike. By the end of the 18th century the vineyards of Saint-Pourçain covered more than 8,000 hectares. Today the vineyards total 600 hectares. The appellation received AOC status in 2009. Denis Barbara farms several separate parcels of land totaling 8 hectares. Two thirds of his production is in red wine. He works alone except for the harvest and does much of the vineyard work by hand. He keeps his yields very low by bud pruning “ebourgeonnage” in the spring and green harvesting in the summer after “veraison”. He cultivates grasses between all the rows and does not use insecticides, pesticides or chemical fertilizer in his vineyards. All of his wines are fermented with indigenous yeasts.`,

          content: `Founded at the beginning of the XXth century by Clément Manguin, Romain’s great grandfather, the domaine was then passed on to Clément’s son in law, Robert Guiberteau, a talented winemaker and one of the founding members of the cave cooperative of Saumur. In 1954, recognizing the great potential of this terroir, Robert purchased several hectares on the hill of Brézé, in particular the Clos des Carmes, considered by legendary gourmet Curnonsky as one of the grand crus of the Loire Valley. When Robert retired in 1976 none of his children wanted to take over and the domaine was farmed out. In 1996, at the end of a lease cycle, Romain Guiberteau, who was flailing as a law student, decided to take over the management of his family’s vineyards rather than see the leases renewed. The following year, under the mentoring of Clos Rougeard’s Nady Foucault, Romain made 5000 bottles of red wine that he managed to sell easily. The success convinced him to pursue a qualitative approach to winemaking and to gradually take back his grapes from the cooperative. The domaine is 9.4 hectares (under plantation, there is 12 hectares total), 7 of which are located in the great terroir of Brézé. A little more than half of the surface is planted to Chenin with the remainder planted to Cabernet Franc. Age of vines varies between 4 and 80 years old, with a hefty proportion of old vines. In 2000, Romain converted the vineyards to organic management and in 2003 he began the process towards the AB organic certification, obtaining it in 2007.`,

They are located in the heart of the Cheverny and Cour-Cheverny AOC’s and currently have 23 ha of vines. The vineyard exists in a microclimate that keeps the vineyards cool, situated between the Loire River and the forest of Cheverny, Chambord and Solonge and has been Ecocert certified since 1998. Philippe believes that a wine should be the expression of the place from which it comes and should reflect the climatic conditions of the year, as well as the vigneron that produces it, while also respecting the life of the soil and the environment. He believes that it should give pleasure but must also be sound and healthy, alive and digestible and above all, it should be a natural wine.`,
